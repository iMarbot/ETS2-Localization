[blue]Universal English Localizations for Countries & Cities

[normal]Some map mods do not properly provide localize their names to Enlgish or the local language.
[normal]This mod aims to fix that and hopefully push forward localization which has existed since v1.33.

[normal]If you want this mod to universally work with any version of the above maps, then please ask the mod author to add localization to their maps properly.

[normal]Information on how to do this can be found in Step 1 here: https://promods.net/viewtopic.php?t=32517

[normal](Step 2 will continue to be handled by this mod, unless the author also wishses to add English localization themselves.)
