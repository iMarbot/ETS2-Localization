## How to Contribute
* **IMPORTANT:** Do not use GitHub's automatic branching tools for creating patches/editing single files on the `main` branch!
* In fact, don't do anything on the `main` branch at all, please, it makes it so difficult to merge while keeping you as the commit author ðŸ˜¢.
1. Decide which mod you want to help localize or update:
	* [`srm`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/srm) - Southern Region
	* [`tgs`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/tgs) - The Great Steppe
	* [`roex`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/roex) - Romania Extended (ROEX)
	* [`sibir`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/sibir) - SibirMap
	* [`volga`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/volga) - Volga Map
	* [`kirov`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/kirov) - Kirov Map
	* [`azge`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/azge) - ROEX AZGE Addon
	* [`caucasus`](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/tree/caucasus) - Project Caucasus
	* If the map you want to add localization for isn't yet supported, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/iMarbot/ETS2-Localization/issues/new).
2. Navigate to the branch for that mod using the links above (or your favourite way if you're experienced with Git).
3. Fork that branch, **not** `main`, or use GitHub's tools to edit/create a file **within that branch**.
4. Please test the changes you make by replicating the changes to a local copy of the mod zip and running it in ETS2.
	* *It shouldn't trigger re-caching of routes, so the process should be relatively fast*
	* Take a screenshot of the updated section of the map, if you can, and keep it for later
5. Create a pull request to merge your updated forked branch into the branch from which you initially forked it from.
	* I.e., if you forked `volga`, make a PR merge request into `iMarbot/volga` and **not** `iMarbot/main`!
	* If you had taken any screenshots of the map with your changes, please add them as part of the pull request.
	* Feel free to include a link to where you wish to be credited to (i.e., Twitter account) on the ProMods forum thread.
6. You're done! Now just wait for me to review and merge or request changes to your branch.
	* I get an email every time there's a PR or comment, so don't worry, I won't miss it.
7. Thank you for contributing!
